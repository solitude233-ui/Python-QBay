Sophia:  
  Assigned task(s):  Create QBay-CLI docker container/Ship docker container & docker compose  
  Progress:  Pushed docker image to https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sophiaperzan/qbay  Pushed docker changes directly to main since its code everyone will need to pull changes from anyway. No PR neccessary since it was already verified and released by instructor.  
  Encountered difficulties:  None so far, I've used docker before so its familiar
  Current plan:  Help out Sean with Docker and finish the rest of deployment before deadline
