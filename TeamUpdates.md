Aidan:  
  Assigned task(s):  Create front end test cases for login and register function
  Progress:  Created two blackbox boundary tests for register and used example test_login.py function
  Encountered difficulties:  Need to clean up a few things in my code and also need to get test_login.py file working
  Current plan:  Still need to create a test_register.py file and finish creating test cases for login and register
  
Jules:  
  Assigned task(s):  Create front end testing for update_user_profile function on branch sprint4_juliana.  
  Progress:  Decided on and currently developing three Black Box testing methods including input/output partition testing.
  Encountered difficulties:  Possibly considering shotgun testing for postal code values.  
  Current plan:  Continue to develop test cases and determine if shotgun testing is needed.  

Sean:  
  Assigned task(s): Create front end test cases for create_product function.  
  Branch: sprint4-Sean  
  Progress: Finished most test cases and pushed to repo.  
  Encountered difficulties: N/A  
  Current plan: Finishing all test cases and add test_create_product.py.  
  
  
Sophia:  
  Assigned task(s): Test UpdateProduct, on sprint4-Sophia branch  
  Progress: Decided what blackbox testing methods to use (input/output partitioning with shotgun for robustness)  
  Encountered difficulties: Shotgun works best for numerical values, less so for more 'open ended' inputs like products and strings.  
  Current plan: Finish up partitioning then for each partition test, make a copy which is in the same partition class, but uses shotgun for inputs/outputs where applicable
