Sean:  
  Assigned task(s): Create front end test cases for create_product function.  
  Branch: sprint4-Sean  
  Progress: Finished most test cases and pushed to repo.  
  Encountered difficulties: N/A  
  Current plan: Finishing all test cases and add test_create_product.py.  
  
  
Sophia:  
  Assigned task(s): Test UpdateProduct, on sprint4-Sophia branch  
  Progress: Decided what blackbox testing methods to use (input/output partitioning with shotgun for robustness)  
  Encountered difficulties: Shotgun works best for numerical values, less so for more 'open ended' inputs like products and strings.  
  Current plan: Finish up partitioning then for each partition test, make a copy which is in the same partition class, but uses shotgun for inputs/outputs where applicable
